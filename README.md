# **NYC TLC Trip Record Dataset Overview**

## **Introduction**  
The NYC TLC Trip Record Dataset is a publicly available dataset that contains detailed records of taxi trips in New York City. This dataset is released by the New York City Taxi and Limousine Commission (TLC) and is widely used for transportation analysis, traffic optimization, and fraud detection.  

However, the dataset used only covers **January 2023**, meaning this analysis is limited to that specific time period. Additionally, three anomalous rows were found with years different from 2023. These anomalies have been separated to prevent distortion in the main analysis.  

## **Data Collection Process**  
The data is collected from taxi and for-hire vehicle (FHV) service providers through trip record submissions. These records are generated by taxi meters and dispatch systems, capturing important trip-related details.  

## **Business Problem**  
Reports indicate that overcharging by taxi drivers in New York City remains a concern. In **November 2021**, the city's Department of Investigation found that several taxi drivers had overcharged passengers by adding non-existent or inflated tolls. **Four current and two former drivers pleaded guilty** to felony charges related to this scheme.

As of **2023**, there have been no widely reported incidents of taxi drivers overcharging passengers in New York City. However, the city has implemented measures that affect taxi fares, such as congestion pricing. In **2023**, taxis made about **12 daily trips**, and passengers are responsible for paying the tolls, so it's advisable to check your receipts.

The main objective of this analysis is to **detect potential overcharging** in taxi fares and examine whether overcharging trends persisted in **2023**. Unfair pricing can damage customer trust and lead to regulatory action against service providers.  

## **Analysis Objective**  
To address the business problem of detecting potential overcharging in NYC taxi fares, we will analyze several key aspects of the dataset:  

- **Identifying Unusual Fare Patterns:** Examining trip distances and total fares to detect cases where passengers may have been overcharged, either through inflated pricing or unnecessary detours.  
- **Assessing External Factors Impacting Fare Variations:** Investigating how different conditions‚Äîsuch as peak hours or major city events‚Äîaffect fare pricing and whether any excessive charges are justified.  
- **Examining Vendor Performance:** Analyzing fare discrepancies across different taxi service providers to determine if certain vendors have a higher rate of overcharging incidents.  

This analysis will provide actionable insights to **detect unfair pricing**, **improve customer trust**, and **ensure compliance** with NYC taxi regulations.

## **Conclusion**  
Based on the analysis of the **NYC TLC Trip Record dataset for January 2023**, using the **IQR method** to identify fare anomalies, we found that there is an **overcharging rate of approximately 4.3%**, which translates to **2,569 trips**. Although this percentage might seem low, the absolute number of potentially overcharged trips is significant.  

### **Key Findings:**  

- **üìç Geographical Concentration:** Overcharging incidents are **not evenly distributed** across New York City. A notable concentration of these cases was observed in areas such as **Harlem (both South and North)** and other neighborhoods like **Forest Hills**, where the absolute number of trips with overcharging is higher.  
- **üöñ Vendor Analysis:** Both **Vendor 1 and Vendor 2** have recorded overcharging cases. While **Vendor 2** tends to have a **higher volume of trips**, leading to more absolute cases of overcharging, **Vendor 1** also shows instances of overcharging in certain zones.  
- **‚è≥ Event Factors Not Considered:** Event factors, such as **rush hour**, were not explicitly analyzed in this study. This is because any additional charges related to peak times are already included in the `"extra"` field, meaning they do not directly affect the fare per mile or the **fare/distance ratio** used in our analysis.  

### **Recommendations:**  

‚úî **Vendor Improvements:** Both vendors should implement measures to **reduce overcharging incidents**. This could involve **enhanced driver training** and **more rigorous internal monitoring** of fare calculations.  

‚úî **Enhanced Monitoring:** Introduce a **license plate tracking system** and a **driver feedback mechanism**. Such tools can help in **early identification** and warnings for drivers who consistently engage in overcharging practices.  

‚úî **Educational Initiatives:** Develop and distribute **comprehensive tour guidelines** for high-risk areas (e.g., **Harlem, Forest Hills**) to educate both drivers and passengers. This initiative will help ensure that **drivers adhere to fair pricing practices** and that **passengers are informed** about standard fare expectations.  

‚úî **Regulatory Oversight:** Increase **regulatory oversight** to enforce **transparency** and compliance with fare calculation guidelines. **Continuous monitoring** can help maintain trust among consumers and prevent future incidents of overcharging.
